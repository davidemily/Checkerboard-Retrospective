# Daeth5 Checkerboard-Retrospective
#### I'll be comparing my old Checkerboard solution with the official solution in the hope of becoming a better programmer.

## Reflect on the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?


## How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?

## How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly?

## How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?

## How could you improve going foward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?
