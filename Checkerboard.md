# Daeth5 Checkerboard-Retrospective
I'll be comparing my old Checkerboard solution with the official solution in the hope of becoming a better programmer.

#### Reflect on the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?
--- 
The code for the checkerboard was difficult for me. I spent a year away from programming in OO and from the Java FXML environment. While picking up the syntax of Java wasn't too hard, relearning the details of inheritance and interfaces was.

For the most part, my code matched that of the solution. There were some small changes in the methods of the Checkerboard and Controller class.

#### How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?
--- 
#### How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly?
--- 
#### How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?
--- 
#### How could you improve going foward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?
